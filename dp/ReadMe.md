Basic dp problems + approximate solutions of some NP-complete problems

1. NP-complete - every problem in class NP can be reduced to it and there exists a non-deterministic algorithm
2. NP-hard - any problem in NP can be reduced to it. 
3. NP - polynomial time with non-deterministic algorithm
4. P - polynomial time with deterministic algorithm
