Basic dp problems + approximate solutions of some NP-complete problems

NP-complete - every problem in class NP can be reduced to it and there exists a non-deterministic algorithm
NP-hard - any problem in NP can be reduced to it. 
NP - polynomial time with non-deterministic algorithm
P - polynomial time with deterministic algorithm
