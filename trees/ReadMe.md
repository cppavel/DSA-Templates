1. The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l

2. The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1

3. In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is Log2(N+1) 

4. A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least Log2L + 1 levels

5. In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children: T = L-1

6. |E| = L + I – 1

7. L = I + 1 (L = (k - 1)*I + 1 for k-ary tree)

7. Handshaking lemma - sum of degrees is equal to 2|E| (undirected graph)

8. T(n) = (2n)! / (n+1)!n! - catalan's number, number of unlabeled binary trees with n nodes Hence T(n)*n! is the number of labeled trees.
